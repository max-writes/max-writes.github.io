What I'm up to lately.

I'm rebuilding this site from scratch! Well, sort of. Instead of using Obsidian, I'm using a combination of <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/" target="_blank">Quartz</a> (preferring to make my pages by hand than to use Obsidian), <a href="https://anytype.io/" target="_blank">Anytype</a>, and <a href="https://leaflet.pub/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> to deliver my digital garden. Each has its own pros/cons for delivering content and I'm captalizing on the pros to make a diverse PKMS for myself. 

I have a lot of stuff to add still as I migrate the existing content in addition to stuff I made, but never put online because Obsidian was too limiting for the things I wanted to do.

What I've been doing with websites:
- This site: Trying to figure out how to use Github! It took about 5 hours of troubleshooting but I figured out how to fork, commit to MY git (instead of trying to commit to Quartz directly, oops), view my site locally to draft changes before publishing, and (mostly) tweaked the layout. There are a lot of changes still to make but I'm proud of myself for getting this all together!
- Thinking often lately about <a href="https://frankenweb.neocities.org/manor/" target="_blank">Phantom Manor</a> and what kind of seasonal things I might add before we get to September...

What's going on creatively:
- I've been making lots of zines! A zine factory! I started my winter seasonal zine and made a few 1-page zines about projects and creative things I have going on. Also, I've added a bunch of ideas to my zine ideas list. 'Tis the season for zining!

What's going on at work:
- We just completed another reorg after our major work transition that just ended in December. Lots of change is coming! It's scary but I feel relatively safe/secure and not worried about my job, just uncertain what's next in line as things sit in the "in between" before a transition settles.
- I've been working in Clipchamp more, making short training videos or demos. I finally got comfortable enough to work fairly quickly and now I'm able to budget enough time to create a month-in-review recap of releases that impacted workflows around the online classroom. I'm trying to keep it at maximum 5 minutes so it's quite bite sized, but I've gotten some good feedback so far! Excited to see how that improves throughout the year, and where this new video editing skill takes me.
