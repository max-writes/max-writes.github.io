1. All of this is random/chaos, so find purpose from within and allow it to change throughout life.
2. Everyone's reality is different and changes in perspective are as meaningful as major life events.
3. Each person has a pace and flow that is unique to them, but sometimes your flow can mesh well with another person's or group's.
4. Stillness begets stillness, movement begets change. Stillness is essential to gather energy for movement.
5. Process is everything and helps define the product. The journey helps define the experience at the destination.
6. You can't make yourself grow, but you create the conditions for growth to occur.
7. You have to build your own community and find your people - no one is going to do that for you.
8. The mind dwells on what the heart needs to heal.
9. Keep a growth mindset to learning how to be a person in this world.
10. The stories you don't tell consume you. Share your thoughts.
