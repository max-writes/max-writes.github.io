## I. Introduction: From Copy Machines to Code Editors
- Link the tactile rebellion of zines to handmade websites/indieweb ethos
- hand-coded sites are the modern continuation of zine culture: DIY, intimate, expressive, rooted in creative autonomy
- Compare cultural roles of zines and hand-coded sites through lenses of access, community, aesthetics, and resistance

## II. Bite-Sized History of Zine Culture
- Discuss the legacy of zines as personal, rebellious media
	- 1930s sci-fi fanzines
	- '70s/'80s punk movement
	- '90s riot grrl and indie scenes
- DIY production and distribution (photocopiers, mail trades, record stores) - political and subcultural expression outside of mainstream publishing

## III. Early Internet Webspace
- Connect early web culture to the same handmade ethos
- '90s to early '00s: Personal websites and webrings as digital equivalents of zine networks
	- Instead of a 'copy machine' - online web space via HTML
- Website as self-expression, not a product
	- Personal designs, blinking things, GIFs, personal essays, link lists, art
	- digital punk DIY

## IV. Digital Zine Renaissance
- Contrast the handmade web with the rise of centralized, commercial platforms
	- Shift from personal pages to social media profiles, then to algorithmic feeds
	- Standardized aesthetics
	- Monetized attention
- Expression turned into content; creativity is optimized for engagement
- Hand-coded sites revive zine values in a digital medium
- Creators reclaim the web through:
	- Personally designed sites, digital gardens, personal blogs
	- Micro projects, browser game development, shrines
- Like zines, websites:
	- Built with love, not scalability
	- personal, imperfect, ever-evolving to the creator's desires
	- shared in small circles (though websites can be globally accessible in a way zines aren't always)
	- cultural and creative autonomy - making by hand resists the industrialization of expression
	- personal sites restore ownership, intimacy, and narrative control - there is value in authenticity and connection

## V. Conclusion: Keep the Web Weird and Expressive
- Hand-coded websites are digital zines: small, expressive acts of resistance in a homogenized digital landscape
- Call to action: Build your weird corner of the web, if that's what you want to do. Even without "fans" or "followers" there is value in sharing.
