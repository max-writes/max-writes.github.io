1. I see expression media as narrative canvas. I don’t just post online; I build experiences. To me, a website is a chance to make a living zine curated to create a journey, where the layout tells as much of the story as the text. Whether I’m coding a page or assembling paper into a booklet, my approach is narrative-driven: I am seeking to create a homebase that feels intimate and intentional. (Sometimes I am the audience.)
2. The medium and rhythm influences the message. I believe the pace of my sharing influences the depth of the connection I feel. While social media demands instant, disposable noise, I prioritize slower online options. To me, the medium and the tempo matter as much as the thing being shared; true reflection requires a slower frequency. Whether my goal is slow digital gardening and learning loudly, or seasonal reflections hidden
3. I embrace the "Frankensthetic." I have a deep love for the DIY aesthetic, the "Franken-thing" approach where bits of media are stitched together. Think of it like a lifestyle approach adopting elements from mixed media art. I embrace faults, visible seams, and creative messiness. Perfection is great, but there is a vibrant, kinetic energy in the "glitch." It proves a human was here, trying their best.
4. The architecture of my well-being. My emphasis on mental and emotional health is born from necessity. Having navigated much of my life through a lens that didn't always match the "standard" frequency (learning of my neurodivergence later in life), I’ve learned that emotional regulation isn't a luxury; it’s a survival skill. I share this journey to make the invisible visible, advocating for a world where we honor our unique internal wiring and find ways to make it work in the context.
5. Radical growth and lifelong learning. I carry a growth mindset into every corner of my life. For me, "learning" isn't just about a classroom or a skill set; it’s an ontological state. I am constantly uncovering new layers of the world, others, and myself. If I am not evolving, I am not truly observing.
6. My toolkit is always changing. I am fascinated by the alchemy of tools. I love experimenting with different combinations of software, hardware, and stationery to see which specific collection will bridge the gap between my vision and reality. The "how" is a puzzle I never tire of solving.
7. The friction of expression. Creativity is rarely a straight line. I struggle openly with consistency and the limitations of my own energy and skill. My most expressive work requires a specific kind of solitude that can be hard to find in a shared world.
8. My Muses: Tension & Love. My creativity lives on a scale between Love and Tension. If there is too much tension, the system breaks; if there is too much love (as I am happily experiencing now!), the "creative itch" can settle into a comfortable silence. My challenge is finding that sweet spot of "productive friction" where the heart is full but the mind is still restless enough to create.
9. Presence over productivity! I am unlearning the cult of productivity in favor of presence. I believe in pacing my energy with the shifts in nature. Some seasons are for the "harvest" of high output, while others are for the "wintering" of quiet observation. I strive for intentionality in every click and every keystroke. (During business hours, my pacing is much faster! I am deconstructing that pace outside of paid hours.)
