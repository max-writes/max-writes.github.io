# Notes

Garden freestyle: 
trees
flowers
paths
lawns
birds & butterflies
weeds
soil
water
rocks
walls
steps
hedges

does my digital garden have walls?

network of interconnected notes & pages
non-linear navigation and clear pathways through content
personal exploration & learning
frequent updates/revision history
link to external sources
appealing design

digital garden - space to cultivate thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, iterative manner (rather than strictly structured)

Ideas:
* paths = structured paths through content
* lawns = patches of related things
* notes from sources (books, podcast episodes, articles, etc)
	* 1 per book/thing, write quotes & thoughts
	* birds & butterflies - thoughts from external sources
* fragments - loose notes, thoughts, ideas, etc
	* 1 per thing
	* flowers - ideas that grow when it rains
* synthesis - connections between notes & fragments, reviews of sources, etc - ideally connecting different things and referencing them like in school.
	* trees - ideas have taken root
	- stage of tree growth = how formulated an idea it is vs scratch notes still
	- (like animal crossing)

## How I built myself a Digital Garden

"The Digital Garden is a kind of second brain (I took the wording from Tiago Forte). But it is also a place to wander, to think and reflect, to engage with one’s own thoughts and ideas. A kind of culinary exercise of the mind (according to a phrase by Richard David Precht). It helps me a lot to have a central place where I can file my ideas and, above all, find them again."
